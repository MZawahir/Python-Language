#Q#3 Write a Python program to count the number of even and 
#odd numbers from a series of numbers. 

#Letâ€™s numbers be: 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,11, 14,15,17 
#Output : 
#The no of Even numbers in series are : 4 
#The no of Odd numbers in series are:6 
numbers = (2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9,11, 14,15,17)
count_odd = 0
count_even = 0
for x in numbers:
        if not x % 2:
    	     count_even+=1
        else:
    	     count_odd+=1
print("Number of even numbers :",count_even)
print("Number of odd numbers :",count_odd)
